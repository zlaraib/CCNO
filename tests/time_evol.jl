using ITensors

# We are simulating the time evolution of a 1D spin chain with N sites, where each site is a spin-1/2 particle. 
# The simulation is done by applying a sequence of unitary gates to an initial state of the system, 
# which is a product state where each site alternates between up and down.
let
  N = 100 # number of sites
  cutoff = 1E-8 # specifies a truncation threshold for the SVD in MPS representation
  tau = 0.1 # time step 
  ttotal = 5.0 # total time of evolution 

  # Make an array of 'site' indices
  # conserve_qns=true specifies the quantum numbers (total spin in sys = quantum number "S")
  # that are conserved by the system (as sys evolves)
  s = siteinds("S=1/2", N; conserve_qns=false)  

  # Make gates (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),... i.e. unitary gates which act on neighboring pairs of sites in the chain
  gates = ITensor[] # empty array that will hold ITensors that will be our Trotter gates
  for j in 1:(N - 1)
    s1 = s[j]
    s2 = s[j + 1]
    hj = pi * 0.5 * (
      op("S+", s1) * op("Id", s2) + op("S-", s1) * op("Id", s2) +
      op("S+", s2) * op("Id", s1) + op("S-", s2) * op("Id", s1)
    )
    Gj = exp(-im * tau / 2 * hj)  #making Trotter gate Gj that would correspond to each gate in the gate array of ITensors
    # The push! function adds an element to the end of an array, 
    # ! = performs an operation without creating a new object, (in a wy overwite the previous array in consideration) 
    push!(gates, Gj) # i.e. it appends a new element Gj (which is an ITensor object representing a gate) to the end of the gates array.
  end

  # Include gates in reverse order too i.e. (N,N-1),(N-1,N-2),...
  append!(gates, reverse(gates)) # append! adds all the elements of a collection to the end of an array.

  # Initialize psi to be a product state (alternating up and down)
  psi = productMPS(s, n -> isodd(n) ? "Up" : "Dn")

  c = div(N, 2) # center site # c = N/2 because only half of the spins on the chain are utilized 

  Sz = Float64[] # empty array to store Sz values 
  # Compute and print <Sz> at each time step then apply the gates to go to the next time
  for t in 0.0:tau:ttotal
    sz = expect(psi, "Sz"; sites=c) # computing initial expectation value of Sz at the center of the chain (site c)
    push!(Sz, sz) #The push! function adds an element sz to the end of Sz array, 
    println("$t $sz")

    #shorthand way of writing an if statement that checks whether the current value of t
    # is equal to the final time ttotal, and if so, it executes the break statement, which causes the loop to terminate early.
    t â‰ˆ ttotal && break  

    # The apply function is smart enough to determine which site indices each gate has, and then figure out where to apply it to our MPS. 
    #It automatically handles truncating the MPS and can even handle non-nearest-neighbor gates, though that feature is not used in this example.
    psi = apply(gates, psi; cutoff)# apply each gate in gates successively to the wavefunction psi =  evolving the wavefunction in time according to the time-dependent Hamiltonian represented by the gates.

    #The normalize! function is used to ensure that the MPS is properly normalized after each application of the time evolution gates. 
    #This is necessary to ensure that the MPS represents a valid quantum state
    normalize!(psi)
